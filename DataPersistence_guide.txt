# Data Persistence Guide for Japanese AI Tutor

This app supports two data persistence methods: **JSON** and **SQLite**. You can easily switch between them to suit your needs.

---

## 1. Persistence Methods

- **JSON**: Stores your data in a human-readable `.json` file.
- **SQLite**: Stores your data in a local database file (`.db`), recommended for reliability and larger datasets.

---

## 2. How to Switch Persistence Method

You can change the persistence method in one of three ways:

### a. Edit the Config File

Open `config.py` and set:
    PERSISTENCE_METHOD: str = "sqlite"   # or "json"

### b. Use the Sidebar (Debug Mode)

If debug mode is enabled, use the sidebar dropdown to switch between JSON and SQLite. Click "Switch Persistence" to apply.

### c. Environment Variable

Set the environment variable before running the app:
    On Windows (Command Prompt):
        set JAPANESE_TUTOR_PERSISTENCE_METHOD=sqlite
    Or add to your `.env` file:
        JAPANESE_TUTOR_PERSISTENCE_METHOD=sqlite

## 3. Data Locations

- **JSON**: `data/learned_words.json`
- **SQLite**: `data/japanese_tutor.db`

Backups are stored in the `data/backups/` folder.

---

## 4. Importing and Exporting Data

- Use the sidebar buttons to export your data to a backup file or import a backup.
- When switching between JSON and SQLite, you can export from one format and import into the other.

---

## 5. Clearing All Data

- Use the "Danger Zone" expander in the sidebar to clear all your progress.
- **Warning:** This action is irreversible!

---

## 6. Troubleshooting

- If you see errors about missing files or database issues, check your `data/` folder permissions.
- If you get a slider error, make sure you have more than one word due for review.
- For advanced debugging, enable `DEBUG_MODE` in `config.py` to see detailed error messages.

---

## 7. Recommendations

- For most users, **SQLite** is recommended for better performance and reliability.
- Regularly export backups to avoid data loss.
